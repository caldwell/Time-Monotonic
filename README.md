Time::Monotonic
===============

### Monotonically incrementing clock source for Perl

Time::Monotonic gives access to monotonic clocks on various platforms (Mac
OS X, Windows, and POSIX). A monotonic clock is a time source that won't
ever jump forward or backward (due to NTP or Daylight Savings Time updates).

Time::Monotonic uses Thomas Habets's cross platform [monotonic_clock][1]
library under the hood.
