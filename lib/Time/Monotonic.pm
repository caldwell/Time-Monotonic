=head1 NAME
Time::Monotonic - A clock source that only increments and never jumps

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Time::Monotonic qw(monotonic_time);
  $t1 = monotonic_time();
  sleep(1);
  $t2 = monotonic_time();

  die unless Time::Monotonic::is_monotonic();
  say "Backend API: ".Time::Monotonic::backend();

  $oo = Time::Monotonic->new;
  $oo->now;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Time::Monotonic gives access to monotonic clocks on various platforms (Mac
OS X, Windows, and POSIX). A monotonic clock is a time source that won't
ever jump forward or backward (due to NTP or Daylight Savings Time updates).

Time::Monotonic uses Thomas Habets's cross platform "monotonic_clock"
library under the hood.

=head1 API

=over 4

=item C<monotonic_time()>

This function returns a monotonic time as a floating point number
(fractional seconds). Note that this time will not be comparable to times
from the built-in C<time> function. The only real use of the value is
comparing against other values returned from C<monotonic_time()>.

=item C<backend()>

This function returns which backend clock functions are in use. It will be
one of:

=over

=item C<'clock_gettime'> (POSIX)

=item C<'mach_absolute_time'> (Mac OS X)

=item C<'QueryPerformanceCounter'> (win32)

=item C<'generic'> (none of the above)

=back


=item C<is_monotonic()>

This will return true if the backend supports monotonic clocks. This I<can>
return false if there is no support for monotonic clocks in the current
Platform/OS/hardware combo.

=back

=head1 OO Interface

Creating a new instance of ourself stores the current monotonic counter
value as a blessed scalar reference.  Consecutive calls to
C<<$instance->now>> returns the time difference since the moment of
instanciation.  This behavior is equivalent to L<Time::HiRes/tv_interval>.

  my $t0 = Time::Monotonic->new;
  my $t1 = $t0->now;

The constructor also accepts an offset value, which will be added to the
counter value.

  my $t0 = Time::Monotonic->new($offset);
  my $t1 = $t0->now;

Deferencing returns the initial value:

  print "timer started at: ", $$t0;
